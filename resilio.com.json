With Resilio, our engineers always have the most recent designs, wherever they happen to be located.ââ Emanuele Guidolin, IT Manager at Maffeis EngineeringâResilio has been a valuable partner in transforming our operations at Ziosk. Their scalable solutions have helped Ziosk to deploy software and compelling user experiences to our customers, even in low bandwidth environments. The flexibility and efficiency of their solution has enhanced service quality while maintaining smooth day-to-day operations. With Resilio's robust technology, we can focus on what we do bestâimproving the dining experience for our guests.ââ Eric Neilson, CTO at ZioskâOn the narrative and VFX side, we really dig Resilio. It really works well for our level of production. We directed and produced Prospect with Pedro Pascal. Compared to the big studios, we operate on a much lower budget.Before Resilio, the logistics aspects of post were absurd; people driving hard drives from Seattle to Vancouver, Canada, was just crazy.ââ Zeek Earl, Director at Shep FilmsâResilio was the one program that truly met our needs. Making it the clear choice with their file-sharing solutions is incredibly fast and secure.The real-time data synchronization has streamlined our workflow even further. On top of that, their fail-safe solution, the Archive folder, rescued us a number of times.ââ Federico Torres, IT Support Manager at ReadySetâWe've seen a great increase in confidence among users that files will be available on both servers when saving; peace of mind is definitely a great value for both users and the IT staff.Resilio gave us everything we needed, including reliability and at-a-glance reports, when it comes to file sharing.ââ Francesco Troili, IT Support Manager at IT International TelecomâResilio provided us with a robust automated solution to keep an extremely large file system in sync with our DR environment very quickly, whereas previously, it would have taken us days or even weeks to get things in sync.We are very confident in the Resilio solution, keeping our data in sync and safe, which is exactly what we were looking for.ââ Jonathan Vanasco, Lead DevOps Engineer at CampSystems InternationalâWe were amazed by the ease of use and the performance of slow satellite links. Syncing large directories was no longer a problem. We also used the REST API to create scripts to automate the creation of jobs. This was not possible in the previous solution.The efficiency of the protocols used in Resilio saves us a lot of bandwidth, allowing us to use cheaper satellite links.ââ Marc Ten Hove, IT System Engineer at Van Oord Dredging & Marine Contractors BV\"Resilio transformed our company. The ability to unify all the company assets in a single cloud-based source of truth, allowed our distributed and remote team to work seamlessly without the hassles of the transfers of big amounts of data, especially RAW footage and video projects.ââ Federico T. IT Specialist Engineer\"Resilio has been a game changer. The near real-time sync is impressive. Also, its ability to scale and handle millions of files is what sets it apart from other solutions.

Builds and binaries can be accessed from other available sites or even nearby end systems on the local LAN.Endpoint ScalabilityBuilt on top of the BitTorrent protocol, Resilio Platform can easily scale to 1000s of endpoints, and many TBs of data. The endpoint agents monitor the file system and quickly respond to changes.Updates are distributed between peers and donât depend on the availability or capacity of the centralized management console.Scale OutBuilds are getting bigger and Resilio organically scales out to meet the growing demand, meaning your legacy systems never slow down. No solution scales faster in the face of growing data.FastLeveraging underutilized capacity (idle systems or network) allows Resilio to distribute and synchronize builds up to 10 times faster than existing technologies.Schedule a DemoHow Resilio is Used by DevOpsSynchronize Large ArtifactsKeep large binaries in Sync with Resilioâs N-way.Scalable Build DistributionGet builds out for continuous test, integration and deployment.Mesh Development SitesImprove reliability and speed by deploying Resilio Platform as a full mesh connecting ALL global development sites.Archive and BackupNever lose data.

Read our key factors for a successful NAS migration and avoid any major pitfalls.Trusted by 100s of Business Customers WorldwideP2P: The Fastest Way to Move DataPeer-to-peer technology is the fastest way to distribute data across any network. It reduces the load on the server by channeling the power behind every endpoint connected in your system. Resilio Platform uses similar principles to BitTorrent, but key algorithms like peer-selection and piece-picking were enhanced to meet the needs of an enterprise network.Read the P2P Article or try the Speed CalculatorSpeed Builds to Multiple Remote OfficesWhen distributing builds to more than one location, Resilio connects sites together in a virtual mesh. Thus, Office A sends to Office B while Office B concurrently sends to Office C and so on, resulting in a parallel process many times faster than traditional point-to-point WAN optimization.Crush Idle Time with Concurrent Distribution Over the LANOn the local area network, build distribution is only as fast as the local build server or storage array, meaning access to new builds is often ârate limited,â across the R&D team. Resilio breaks these bottlenecks, allowing builds to be accessed from other local machines faster and more reliably, eliminating idle time in R&D.Efficient Use of the NetworkInstead of multiple concurrent build requests from the cloud clogging the Internet connection with redundant bits, Resilio efficiently spreads load to other local machines, freeing up critical bandwidth while serving builds faster.Additional ResourcesLearn more at the Resources CenterHigh Speed 10+ Gbps File Sync Between LocationsResilio Platform ZGT WAN Optimization reduces data transfer time up to 20xWargaming Case-studyResilio Platform provides Wargaming with a faster, more efficient cross platform sync software.Why P2P is FasterWAN Optimization turns on Resilioâs unique Micro Transport Protocol (ÂµTP2) to reach the maximum speed across any network.Yes, it's another form...But if you make the effort, we'll show you how to move data faster over any network.Yes, it's another form...But if you make the effort, we'll show you how to move data faster over any network.Let's Get StartedTransform data connectivity at your organization â see how with a personalized demo.Let's Get StartedTransform data connectivity at your organization â see how with a personalized demo.

      "title": "Ship to Shore Data Replication and Application Management | Resilio Platform",
      "content": "Resilio PlatformShip to Shore Data Replicationand Application ManagementResilio Platform syncs data and controls apps over any network connectionTry Resilio PlatformSchedule a DemoFast and Automatic Data Transfer from Ship to Shore and BackAutomatic, real-time transfers of data sets from ship to shore at the full available bandwidth regardless of the internet connection, round-trip delay and packet loss. No limit on the file size or the number of files. Resilio Platform's transfer protocol is optimized for high-speed transfer and will automatically ramp up to use the full bandwidth of WiFi when available.Robust to Network OutagesConnectâs fault-tolerant transfer protocol automatically resumes every failed transfer until the job is 100% completed. The automatic retry resumes from the point of interruption and makes efficient use of the costly satellite data network.Download Only The Files That You NeedFast, ad hoc downloads of critical files and data sets from shore to ship through the native file system browser interface.Â This enables simple file sharing and data collection and synchronization over low bandwidth VSAT links.Designed for Multi-homed NetworksResilio Platform makes optimal use of the multiple networks available on the ship.Â It can be configured to minimize the usage of satellite links, make more use of cellular,Â and take full advantage of WiFi connection. Â On the ship, it is capable of syncing data P2P on the LAN without any use of the WAN connections.Schedule a Demo100% Guaranteed Data IntegrityThe Resilio protocol guarantees data is transferred with 100% integrity even with low-quality connectivity including high packet loss and disconnects. Data transmission integrity is verified using cryptographic hashing of each file chunk and each complete file.Resilio WAN Optimization - Micro Transport ProtocolResilioâs Micro Transport Protocol (ÂµTP2) was designed to overcome the deficiencies of TCP/IP over latent and lossy WAN connections. The ÂµTP2 protocol architecture is based on a bulk transfer strategy, where the sender sends packets periodically with a fixed packet delay to create a uniform packet distribution in time and uses a congestion control algorithm to calculate the ideal send rate.There is no acknowledgment for every packet, instead, the protocol uses interval acknowledgment for a group of packets with additional information about lost packets. This acknowledgment combined with periodical RTT (Round Trip Time) probing informs the congestion control algorithm and keeps an optimal sending rate.Workflow Integration and AutomationResilio Platform enables the integration of scripts in transfer jobs. Each job has 3 scripting triggers: prior to starting a transfer job, after a machine completes a transfer, and after all machines complete a transfer.Â This is an easy and powerful mechanism that enables integrating Resilio Platform with your existing workflow.RESTful API exposes all the GUI functionality pragmatically and gives the ability to create jobs, execute jobs, query status, and more.Enterprise ManagementConnectâs Management Console provides a comprehensive view of all transfer jobs. You can view real-time performance metrics, drill into the status of individual endpoints, and review the history of all executed jobs in your network.Â Resilio Platform maintains a complete audit trail and event logs that are stored in a standard JSON format that is compatible with event processing solutions like Splunk, LogRythm, and Loggly.End-to-end SecurityEnd-to-end encryption between mutually authenticated machines is used to guarantee the security and privacy of data on the wire. The 100% on-prem solution with no cloud or 3rd party devices involved gives you complete control over the security of the information.Resilio Cross-Platform CapabilitiesResilio runs on any OS. Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, FreeBSD, and all major NAS solutions are supported. The application is resource-efficient and can deliver high-performance data transfer even on low-end, single-board devices like Raspberry Pi.Bandwidth SchedulerSet bandwidth usage limits based on time-of-day or day-of-week. Create different schedules profiles for different jobs and agent groups.Schedule a DemoUse Case #1 - Application Patching over VSAT LinksOne of the worldâs largest marine construction companies has deployed a comprehensive solution of Resilio Platform software on approximately 30 of its vessels to enable high speed, reliable transfer of data and applications from shore to ship and back.ChallengeDelivering software updates and patching 100s of endpoints on dozens of vessels at sea using SCCM was failing.Â High latencies, connection drops, and limited bandwidth of the satellite links prevented SCCM from doing its job.SolutionResilio Platform offered a way to use SCCM over VSAT.Â The reliable file transfer protocols made it possible to send application patches and OS images over the intermittent satellite connection. Once each vessel received an update, Resilio Platform distributed it to every endpoint on the vessel over the local network. Resilio Platform was a perfect replacement for the vessels SCCM Distribution Points.Â With Resilio Platform installed, updating vessels in the ocean became as reliable and as fast as updating office PCs.The company also took advantage of Resilio's scripting capabilities to remote control application deployment and operating systems upgrades.Read More...Use Case #2 - National Geographic fleet operator uses Resilio Platform for nature photography and logisticsKey Challenges Faced by Lindblad IT OperationsConnecting the Ships to Headquarters ReliablyThe fleet operates far out of range of mobile carriers. Internet connectivity on board each ship is a combination of a 256 kbps Inmarsat FleetBroadband (FBB) connection and a maritime VSAT with a 4 x 4 Mbps connection shared by 150 people. VSAT latencies on Ka and Ku band are between .8 seconds and 1.8 seconds. Average latency is one second, which is more than seven times the delay people are accustomed to hearing on VOIP or browsing the web. Connectivity is precious. Getting data on and off ships is a significant challenge.Sending Batches of Invoices to Ships from HeadquartersPurchasing must send big batches of invoices to ships for resupply in advance of arrival at their next ports of call. These data are critical to ship logistics and continued on-time operations.Publishing Daily Expedition ReportsOnboard each cruise is an expedition team that compiles daily expedition reports, and write-ups that include pictures and stories talking about the experience that guests had that day. These daily reports are often large files and published as a competitive differentiator in service to the National Geographic brand in eco-tourism.Fleet Maintenance Software, Replicating DatabaseThe fleet maintenance software is how each ship places orders for spare parts and maintenance items. Timely database replication is mission critical because any delay in the process can cause major problems if ships leave dock before spare parts arrive.Â Transformative Benefits of Resilio PlatformIn technical trials, Resilio Platform proved itself to be: easy to set up, easy to use, and extraordinarily resilient. It works over FBB satellite and is now fully deployed over VSAT.Today with mapped folder pairs:Staff onboard ships can drop content into folders, without worry, knowing that everything will appear at headquarters on time.Headquarters can replicate software and databases, and push content to ships, with reliable convenience.No more daily anxiety, onboard or at IT headquarters, about making deadline on database replication. Today files replicate reliably 24/7.No more need for crew to watch servers and restart them every 4 hours, as was required prior to adopting Resilio Platform.\"Resilio Platform has been a game changer. Itâs proven to be reliable in file transfer, Itâs proven to be reliable in database replication. Overall, Resilio Platform jobs are very easy to set up and they just work!\"â IT Developer at Lindblad ExpeditionsRead More...Use Case #3 - Northern Marine Group potentially saved millions by reducing time to compliance by 92% with Resilio PlatformKey Challenges Faced by Stena IT OperationsDistributing Critical Software UpdatesShips aren't all that dissimilar to today's enterprise workplaces. They have a dedicated IT infrastructure and rely on WAN communications with the mainland for crew welfare as well as ship logistics and operations.âFor its overall business management, Northern Marine developed and uses Aurora, a custom software system that requires periodic .NET, .NET Core and PowerShell updates. Multi-gigabyte updates to these frameworks have to be pushed out to each vessel over VSAT connections that max out at 3Mb/s down. If the vessel happens to be in a communications black spot, such as the middle of the Indian Ocean, peak download bandwidth slows to 512Kb/s. In the recent past, the only way these updates could be conducted reliably was through the mail.â\"The solution was to burn the software to CD, put it in the post and wait until it got to a vessel. Someone there would then put that CD into the server and install the software,\" says DevSecOps Manager Scott Mungall.Often ship staff required a remote walkthrough through TeamViewerâonce again, over a limited-bandwidth connectionâto install the update properly from the CD. Bringing the entire fleet uniformly up to date could take six months, severely impacting the software deployment cycle of Aurora.SolutionInstead of having to send CDs through the mail and wait for the ship to reach the destination port, Northern Marine now pushes out software updates to the vessels through a combination of Resilio Platform and custom scripts. Using this method, the time needed to bring the fleet into compliance dropped 92%âfrom six months to just two weeks.Read More...Additional ResourcesHands-On Guide To Improving SCCM Distribution With Resilio PlatformLearn More About Resilio PlatformResilio Platform Speed CalculatorSchedule a DemoYes, it's another form...But if you make the effort, we'll show you how to move data faster over any network.Yes, it's another form...But if you make the effort, we'll show you how to move data faster over any network.Let's Get StartedTransform data connectivity at your organization â see how with a personalized demo.Let's Get StartedTransform data connectivity at your organization â see how with a personalized demo.

      "title": "Global File Transfers: Synergy Marine Case Study",
      "content": "BreadcrumbSynergy Marine Group Navigates Global File Transfers With ConfidenceHow the leading ship management company powers ship-to-shore file synchronization with Resilio Active EverywhereFounded with a mission to serve as the most reliable and trusted partner for ship owners and operators worldwide, Synergy Marine Group provides end-to-end maritime solutions to create optimal efficiency, productivity, and customer experience. Headquartered in Singapore, Synergy has a network of 29 offices in 14 countries, employs more than 28,000 seafarers, and manages a fleet of 700 vessels, including container ships, oil and chemical tankers, and bulk carriers.With ships operating 24/7/365, Synergyâs IT team plays a vital role in ensuring that vessel software, security patches, and business-critical applications are consistently and efficiently deployed, regardless of where a ship is located at sea. To exceed customer expectations according to its core values of safety, transparency, and empowerment, Synergy Marine Group relies on Resilio Active Everywhere for secure and scalable ship-to-shore file transfers and software deployment.The ChallengesHandling complex technical hurdles related to data transfers across the global fleetEnsuring seamless data transfer while carrying out ship-shore data transferMaintaining the reliability of data transfer over unstable internet connectivityLarge-sized data needed to be transferred through USB or CDs manually by someone from the shore to the shipData handling scalability in a large fleet within a limited time frameâFor years, the Synergy IT team struggled with one of the marine industryâs most complex technical hurdles: transferring data across a global fleet of ships where internet connectivity is unreliable and often restricted.âWe tried to send files via satellite, but after about 60 or 70MB of data, the connection would drop and transfers would fail,â explained Surya Prakash, Synergyâs IT team lead. âWeâd have to start from scratch or send USB sticks with 2-3GB of important data on them. That was the only way to be sure the data got to the vessels. But it simply wasnât scalable.âThis approach was not only manual and slow but also unsustainable. The team resorted to working around the clock to meet deadlines. They lacked visibility into transfer statuses, and if one failed overnight, progress was lost until someone intervened the next day.Manually deploying applications, updates, and rich media files across hundreds of vessels also meant that critical business needs couldnât be predicted or responded to in real time. Stakeholders and ship owners, often located across different continents, demanded fast and reliable deployments, but traditional methods and tools just couldnât keep up.\"After so many nights staying up late, monitoring the transfers manually just to make sure they completed, thatâs what led us to Resilio. We knew we needed something that could automate the process and handle unstable connections.\"Edison Gurupatham, Vessel IT Manager, Synergy Marine GroupThe SolutionTo modernize and automate its ship-to-shore file delivery infrastructure, Synergy Marine Group turned to Resilio Active Everywhereâa high-performance data replication and management platform that syncs and controls data over any network connection.Resilio offers Synergy, a powerful combination of speed, automation, and resilience that is purpose-built for maritime operations. With real-time transfers that use the full available bandwidthâeven over intermittent or unstable satellite connectionsâResilio enables Synergyâs IT team to move large data sets without size limitations or the need for manual oversight.Synergy selected Resilio Active Everywhere for its:Remote scripting functionality that drastically reduced time-to-deploymentTagging capabilities that provide easy asset management and provisioningRobust APIs to extract logs and export dataResilient file transfer engine that is optimized for low-bandwidth, high-latency environmentsâBefore adopting Resilio, Surya explained that the IT team had to install applications manually, which took an untenable amount of time: âPreviously, we could only deploy to one vessel per day. It took ten people just to do that, and thatâs not counting weekends or holidays. Now, with Resilio, we can install applications on 600 vessels in only two or three days. That used to take us an entire year.âThe scripting tools in Active Everywhere allowed the team to push installations and patch updates directly, while the API enabled automatic logging and export for compliance and reporting. File transfers no longer needed babysitting, and if an interruption occurred, Active Everywhere would resume from where it left offâautomatically and reliably.\"Now that we have Resilio, our lives are simpler and our work is easier. We donât have to worry about whether data gets to the shipsâit just does.âIlaiyakumar M, Head of Cloud & IT Infrastructure, Synergy Marine GroupThe ResultsSince implementing Active Everywhere, the size and scale of data that Synergy Marine Group has been able to manage have been remarkable. In three years, the IT team has transferred over 32 terabytes of data and completed more than 2,000 application deployments, in addition to installs and patch updates.With Resilio on 600+ vessels and counting, the entire fleet is safer and more secure. Resilio has enabled Synergy to eliminate the risk and inefficiency of manual deployments, as well as created newfound agility in responding to unpredictable business needs around the world.Even with the complexities of fleet operations, including changing ownership expectations and cost-conscious stakeholders, Synergy has renewed its partnership with Resilio for another two years, demonstrating a clear proof of value.\"90% of our stakeholders care about the price of the solutions we use, and only 10% care about technology. But they trust us to make the right decision and deliver, and Resilio delivers.âIlaiyakumar M, Head of Cloud & IT Infrastructure, Synergy Marine GroupSummarySynergy Marine Groupâs IT transformation illustrates the power of automation, resilience, and intelligent synchronization in maritime operations. What once took months now takes days, and the team no longer loses sleep over failed transfers or delayed deployments.As Synergy looks ahead, Resilio Active Everywhere will remain central to their mission of continuous innovation, helping the team deliver fast, secure, and seamless IT services across all seven seas.If youâre managing complex operations across remote, distributed teams, schedule a demo of Resilio Active Everywhere today to see how you can ensure mission-critical data gets where it needs to goâfast and reliably.

      "title": "Solution Guide for Game Developers & Studios | Resilio",
      "content": "Solution GuideResilio for Game Developers & StudiosFaster game development for global teams working everywhereâon-premises, cloud, and edgeTrusted by creators of the worldâs most loved game studiosExecutive SummaryResilio is a software-only solution that allows game developers and studios to accelerate game development and testing. It utilizes a distributed file transfer architecture to achieve faster build distribution and data synchronization across various locations.Key benefits of Resilio include:Faster build distribution times (up to 10x faster than conventional tools)Reduced testing timeImproved productivity for development teamsCost savings through efficient data transfer and infrastructure utilizationResilio works by establishing a network of agents across different locations. These agents collaborate to distribute and synchronize files, ensuring that teams have the latest builds and assets whenever needed. Resilio also offers caching functionalities to store frequently accessed data locally, further improving access speeds.âConventional ApproachesConventional tools are limited by point-to-point and hub-and-spoke architectures, which are performance bottlenecks for DevOps, Engineering, IT, and QA testing.Global File Systems (GFS)Expensive and constrained by hub-and-spoke topologiesBuild and asset distribution, sync, and updates flow through a hub, which is a performance bottleneckÂ Point-to-point tools do not scale beyond 2 endpointsPoint-to-point tools do not scale beyond 2 endpointsRobocopy, Rsync, Unison, et al, rely on TCP and limit transfers to 2 systemsTools from Aspera and Signiant, while UDP-based, are also constrained by point-to-point and do not scaleDFS Replication (DFSR)âClient/server is unreliable, performs poorly, and introduces unnecessary risk of data corruption and troubleshooting complexityÂ âThe Resilio ApproachDevOps, engineering, IT, and playtesting teams use Resilio in the most time- and talent-intensive game development companies and studios. We work closely with our customers to meet their requirements and deliver complex games on timeâusing existing IT and cloud infrastructure.Â âOur approach includes:Speed and ScaleResilio efficiently transfers and synchronizes files of any size and type in parallel across endpoints and nodes you define.A new scale-out caching gateway enables high-performance storage caching across locations.Â Â We synchronize millions of files or objects in real-time or on-demand without latency and loss.AutomationResilio is API-driven and automation-ready for easy operations.Our platform automates routine tasks through policies, scripting, and APIs.Automated cache management (hydration, dehydration, and file & folder pinning) minimizes transfer times and ensures the right teams have the right builds & assets.Reliability & SecurityResilio combines P2P with dynamic routing and fault tolerance to deliver the most resilient and fault-tolerant file delivery system available.Additionally, our team is as dependable as the platform itself, thanks to 24x7 global support to ensure users have access to help whenever they need it.Resilio does not rely on third-party security services or VPNs, so security and encryption are built in end-to-end.âKey BenefitsResilio is easy to operate at any scale. DevOps, IT, engineering, and QA teams can do more in fixed time frames and improve productivity. Resilio helps companies deliver complex games in fixed time frames using existing infrastructure.âOur engineers deployed a successful test version in an hourâwithout reading a ton of manuals. Resilio delivered the best result of all the solutions we tried.ââ Roman Sakno, Enterprise Architect atÂ WargamingProductivity winsResilio provides unified file access to file data across all locations. This unified approach boosts productivity by eliminating the complexities of managing data across multiple locations and platforms. As a result, team members can concentrate on their primary roles without the hassle of navigating disparate data sources.Operational winsWith complete API coverage, Resilio streamlines and automates development workflows. Its policy-based data governance enables precise control over data management, making operations easy at any scale. This automation-friendly environment reduces the burden of manual data distribution tasks and allows teams to allocate more resources to creative endeavors.ROI: Deliver complex games on time and under budgetThe most demanding game developers and animation studios trust Resilio to speed up build distribution by up to 10x over conventional toolsâand reduce testing and management time. Resilio helps game developers and studios bring complex products to market faster using existing software, hardware, and CI/CD pipelines. For DevOps, engineering, and QA teams, this translates to saved timeâand doing more within a fixed amount of time.âUse CasesDistributed Global File System using Object StorageResilio offers a complementary solution and, in some cases, an alternative to global file systems. With new capabilities for automated multi-site caching and storage, customers can extend their investments in deployed storage for various game development and QA use cases.In one use case, a golden copy of a build can be maintained on-premâusing any NAS or object storage system. Resilio provides file-level access to objectsâmaking objects available as files within and across sites at speeds you define.Â Caching automation policies can be combined with push scenariosâsuch as full synchronizationâwhere a complete or partial data set is synchronized with a remote cache in a remote site. This synchronization can be combined with multiple cloud regions or other data centers. Customers may choose to synchronize primary storage systems bidirectionally, such that a change could be made to any primary store and reflected in different sites.Â Â Another scenario is to pull files on-demand. In this scenario, a remote cache or remote agent can pull files. This can be user- or application-driven through a capability called transparent selective syncâor automated based on a file caching policy.Â Â The Resilio platform provides tremendous efficiency for ensuring the right files, such as builds and assets, are delivered to the right place (any other Resilio agent) at the right timeâeither through a push or pull synchronization or via automated file caching policies.âCentral Archive Accessible EverywhereResilio provides high-performance file access to high-capacity storage (composed of any file, block, and object storage). Teams and operators can thus centrally store and make available hundreds of millions of builds and assetsâat low costâacross any number of locations. Resilio can then be used to efficiently store, distribute, synchronize, and share builds and assets. In one scenario, you could define two primary storage systems: one in an on-prem data center as JBOD or NAS and another in the public cloud as object storage.When a build is ready, it can be synchronized in real-time bidirectionally between the two primary storage systems and made available for distribution across remote sites and teams. A key advantage of Resilio is controlling which builds and associated assets go to each remote site or team. You can deliver specific builds to each remote site.Â For example, one remote studio may be responsible for PC testing, and the other site may be responsible for Xbox console playtesting. By setting a caching policy for each site, you can specify which builds and assets go to each site.The team testing PCs will receive the PC installer and exclude the Xbox-related testing kit and materials, and vice versa. Or you may have one facility performing manual QA and another running a separate, automated test in the cloud.Â Â With Resilio, creating a file policy specifying the cache size at each remote site and file types to be pulled and cached is easy. By setting file policies for each gateway at each site, each studio could have its own policy. This way, you can pre-cache and pin files based on location, workflow, or job function.Once a build is staged, you can set a hydration policy to download files of specific types to each remote caching location. Upon completion, a dehydration policy purges the cache. You can include and exclude specific files and folders in each cache and keep certain files âpinnedâ to the cache for reuse.Â Benefits of using Resilio as a build and asset archive include:WAN optimization: Allocated bandwidth to each site down to the device-level. Resilio achieves full utilization of allocated bandwidth across any network.Â Â Minimize transferred data: Your caching policy determines what files are delivered where. Once a project is complete, policies dehydrate the cache to free up space automatically.Â API-controlled functions based on policies and triggers: All functions can be scripted, automated through an API, or performed through the UI.Minimize transferred data: Your caching policy determines what files are delivered where. Once a project is complete, policies dehydrate the cache to free up space automatically.Â API-controlled functions based on policies and triggers: All functions can be scripted, automated through an API, or performed through the UI.âHybrid WorkResilio offers unified file access for hybrid work. Your teams can be anywhereâin the office or working remotely. All usersâDevOps, engineers, IT, QAâmaintain the same user experience across all locations.Â There are two primary use cases in hybrid work: push and pull. In the automated push scenario, you can efficiently distribute and stage builds for remote teams based on policies. You can automatically distribute files to your remote teams based on policies and job functions in this scenario.Â Â End-users run a Resilio agent on their device and operating system, including Windows, macOS, or Linux. Hybrid work caching transforms an end-user desktop or workstation into a smart caching station.In gaming, builds, assets, and artifacts of varying sizes and types need to be readily accessible to teams located anywhere.For hybrid work, Resilio enables:Unified and resilient access to files and folders from any device and locationMany-to-many collaborations and iterations within and across teamsÂ Predictable transfer and synchronization times within and across teamsWAN optimization to overcome latency and packet loss associated with distanceRapid and easy access to files of any size typeâfrom massive builds to many smaller artifactsSmart caching on-demand so that files can be cached and pinned for efficient reuseâBuild and Asset DistributionUsing Resilio, a single job can automate and (optionally) synchronize build distribution across unlimited locations and up to thousands of endpoints. DevOps, for example, can use their existing CI/CD pipelines, including Jenkins, TeamCity, and similar solutions.Resilio helps DevOps and QA teams:Reduce iteration time from dev to testCollaborate across distributed studiosAccelerate game release schedulesFacilitate cloud adoptionÂ Leverage existing infrastructure investments in storage, networking, and other resourcesDevOps uses Resilio within their CI/CD pipeline. When a build is ready, Resilio offers highly efficient distribution from one-to-many and many-to-many across the WAN or LAN. Builds can be automatically transferred and synchronized to any number of locations in about the same time it takes to distribute one source build to one destination. Resilio allows you the flexibility to automate the process or distribute builds on a schedule or on-demand.Â Through its P2P architecture, Resilio enables fluid scale-out from one-to-many target destinations or in a full mesh (many-to-many). It simplifies and speeds up build distribution for manual and automated playtesting across any location, including the cloud.Â Â \"The nightly builds that we pump out involve a large amount of data. Getting that synced to every QA team in each studio proved to be quite difficult with the software we had. With Resilio, as soon as our build servers have a build ready, itâs using the entire throughput of our gigabit lines to distribute it to the other studios. So QA can start in the morning on a fresh build.\"â Octaaf Fieremans, producer atÂ Larian StudiosWhen combined with the Resilio caching gateway, the platform ensures the right teams always have the right filesâat the right time. Bandwidth can be allocated to control speeds over WANs and take full advantage of the available bandwidth within a local network.Â Resilio offers complete bandwidth controlâto utilize all allocated bandwidth and harness the resources of all agents collectively participating in a distribution or sync job. Resilio can distribute up to thousands of builds of any size across as many endpoints as are available for the given job.DevOps and game testers continue working with their familiar tools and utilizing their preferred methodologies. Through a single job in the Resilio management console and optional settings for file caching, teams can rapidly distribute, iterate, and work from anywhere.âBurst to LANAnother use case is efficient transfer and multi-directional sync across local-area networks. Resilio rapidly distributes and synchronizes builds in parallel across up to thousands of nodesâwhich can boost performance by 10x and more.From an operational perspective, Resilio maximizes storage efficiency. You can use any type of storage (file, block, or object) and mix-and-match storage configurations (direct-attached, NAS, or SAN). Itâs now possible to achieve faster distribution using existing infrastructure and extend the life of deployed hardware.Teams are more productive. Instead of waiting on builds, they can be iterating and immediately testing the latest builds.Â Â In one scenario, a build server may be hosted on the LAN. A Resilio agent on the server communicates with other compute nodes running Resilio agents to distribute and synchronize files in a one-to-many or many-to-many full mesh. In this scenario, Resilio offers unprecedented speed and scale to burst transfers across the LAN.Â Resilio helps DevOps dramatically reduce infrastructure costs while delivering builds faster than ever, even to remote development teams.Technical AdvantagesThe Resilio solution for game developers and studios offers many technical advantages and capabilities.Efficiency and file data awarenessResilio enhances network efficiency through automated cache management and WAN optimization, featuring file-level awareness and delta detection for reduced redundancy. It offers an on-demand sync capability called transparent selective sync, which allows users to access only needed files, significantly reducing data transfer loads and minimizing cloud egress traffic.Automation-ready cache managementResilio gives administrators granular control and automation over data caching and retention. The cache management is policy-driven and can be manipulated using our comprehensive API. Policies include automated cache management, hydration pre-caching, cache pinning, dehydration, and download priority, all tailored to your teamâs needs.Scale-out caching gatewayOur breakthrough caching capability clusters multiple Resilio agents to provide fast, file-level access to any type of storage, irrespective of latency.Files and objects are stored in their native format rather than in a proprietary file system. As a software-only solution, Resilio supports multiple primary data sources and locations without data migration or new hardware, keeping hundreds of millions of files current across all sites in real-time.Built-in WAN optimizationResilio provides built-in, UDP-based WAN optimization for each P2P connection and across as many endpoints as needed. This enables complete, end-to-end transfer predictability, overcoming the limitations of conventional point-to-point transfer tools.And because no additional software or hardware is required, Resilio seamlessly handles and optimizes every connection it makes.Push or pull workflows for maximum efficiency and timelinessDevOps and other teams can push or pull a build or asset to a dedicated individual or team. Pushes can be scheduled using a distribution job or real-time sync, and with pulls, teams can selectively download or sync only the files needed. All data optimization protocols (WAN, P2P deduplication) work to deliver builds faster than conventional TCP-based approaches.Auto-scale distribution and synchronizationResilio leverages a unique P2P architecture to distribute the load across your infrastructure. With burst to LAN, you can rapidly distribute and optionally synchronize many systems at once. This capability can be used to scale operations across any number of locations, and as demand increases, more nodes can be added.Reliability across any networkResilio combines P2P with intelligent routing and fault tolerance to deliver the most resilient and fault-tolerant system. It finds and uses the fastest possible data source for each facility and connection, offering redundancy through multiple nodes. Block-level awareness ensures distribution continues smoothly after interruptions, seamlessly recovering and picking up where it left off.End-to-end security and data integrityResilio does not rely on third-party security services or VPNs. Our security and encryption are end-to-end. We ensure data integrity through checksums and built-in error correction. Platform capabilities include 100% on-premises or private cloud deployment, end-to-end AES 256 encryption, perfect forward secrecy, air gap readiness, and file and folder access controlled by native ACLs.Next StepsThe Resilio platform stands as a transformative solution for the gaming industry, offering a potent blend of speed, scalability, automation, resiliency, and security. Resilio designed the solution to meet the unique challenges of game development.

      "content": "BreadcrumbHow Maffeis Engineering Maintains Multi-Site Collaboration in Real-Time Between Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the UAEKeeping the latest architectural engineering files up-to-date across worldwide offices is vital, as even small discrepancies can have far-reaching consequences on interdependent projects.Maffeis Engineering designs and engineers some of the worldâs most magnificent large-scale structures. If youâre a soccer fan, you may have seen their stadiums in the 2022 World Cup. They designed and engineered the longest swing railway bridge in the world, spanning the Suez Canal.Their work goes beyond engineeringâand beyond a single site. With headquarters in Solagna, Italy, the Maffeis team depends on Resilio Platform to protect and keep their mission-critical project assets current in real-time for remote teams distributed across many locations.âWhen a change is made to one of our 3D design plans, itâs critical that everyone working on the project immediately sees the change and is working from the most current version of the file,â says Emanuele Guidolin, Maffeisâ IT Manager âWith Resilio Platform, our engineers always have the most recent designs, wherever they happen to be located.âChallengesMaffeis Engineering operates in a highly collaborative multi-site environment where near-real-time project sharing is mission-critical. With a team of more than 300 multidisciplinary contributors across four sites, including engineers, architects, designers, and other staff, they handle large-scale projects with geographically dispersed teams and external partners.âEvery design detail matters,â says Guidolin. âOur primary servers in Italy store many files of many different file types. We use a variety of Autodesk products: AutoCAD, Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Inventor, and Navisworks Freedom. We also use CSI Sap2000 for structural engineering and design. These programs generate a large number of calculation result files. Each file is about 2 GB. Each project contains about 200 to 2,000 filesâor more than 400 GBs. Some of our projects reach 2 TBs of total data.âTheir team needs all of these files to be current across all sites. Each engineer needs the latest file version available on their local storage, irrespective of their location. Â Guidolin emphasizes the mission-critical nature of their engineering work. The design process calculates and optimizes many aspects of constructionâsuch as determining the structural integrity forces on each section of the building. Maintaining the latest file versions across all sites is vital, as even small discrepancies can have far-reaching consequences on interdependent projects.âWhen a change is made to the design, we need those changes immediately available to everyone across all sitesâat the same time. Our design models are used by engineering to calculate and control if the building stays up or down. If someone makes a decision based on inaccurate information, it could be catastrophicâimpacting all of our projects.âEmanuele Guidolin, Maffeis Engineering IT ManagerTimely synchronization is crucial for meeting deadlines. Each project has a dedicated team, working under deadline pressure. âWe may have a building design due on a Monday. To have this ready, we need geological surveys and other information also ready in a timely manner. Many files are involved. Because so many people collaborate remotely, itâs critical that all of the project files be synchronized concurrently.âPrior to adopting Resilio, the IT team tried Dropbox, Layer2, Filecatalyst, and Sharepoint OneDrive, among other tools. Each failed for a variety of reasons. There were issues with slow and incomplete synchronization, file versioning, and even file corruption. âThese tools caused many problems. Prior to Resilio, life in IT was not so good for me, personally,â says Guidolin. âOur IT team is the first line of defense. When an error happens, many people, including our CEO, are not happy. We faced a very difficult time before Resilio.âSolutionFollowing a successful proof-of-concept (POC), Maffeis Engineering selected Resilio Platform as their preferred solution. Resilio Platform is a software-only, centrally managed, agent-based solution. Resilio agents are managed centrally using the Resilio Platform management console. Resilio Platform runs on both physical systems and virtual machines. Itâs cross-platform, running on popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and NAS systems.The solution enables highly reliable real-time collaboration across multiple sites using hybrid infrastructure. Multiple users across multiple sites can make changes that are instantly and efficiently propagated to everyone.Resilio Platform offers several key capabilities that appeal to Maffeis Engineering:Real-time synchronization: Changes made to files are instantly propagated to all authorized devices, ensuring team members have the latest versions.WAN-optimized file transfers: Resilio Platform utilizes its proprietary, UDP-based Zero Gravity Transport (ZGT) to enable high-speed transfers, for large files or files of any size, to enable predictable file delivery times across all endpoints and locations.Robust security and data integrity: Data is protected and encrypted end-to-end, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive project files.âOrganic scalability: Resilio Platform can seamlessly handle the synchronization needs of large-scale projects with numerous team members and external collaborators. Resilio scales to many millions of files per jobâacross many endpoints and locations concurrently.Guidolin was impressed with Resilio Platform. He runs Resilio Platform agents natively on existing NAS storage from QNAP. He only wants to replicate a subset of the dataâand Resilio makes this extremely easy. During the POC, the IT team installed the Resilio Platform management console in Italy and remote agents in Dubai and the other remote sites.ResultsâAfter one month of testing and validation, Resilio Platform solved all of our problems,â says Guidolin. âThe upload, download, and synchronization performance was very fastâexponentially faster than our previous solutions. We like being able to track, monitor, and automate all of our synchronization jobs centrally from our headquarters in Solagna.âBased on their initial success, the IT team continued to expand the Resilio deployment. âFirst we decided to purchase agents for our remote teams in Riyadh. They manage very large files and many files. Resilio makes configuration very simple. You can see if the job is running and the status. Then we decided to also sync our internal projects with our Milan offices. We purchased another QNAP NAS and Resilio agent for that office and licensed the UDP-based WAN optimization feature (ZGT) to speed up working on remote projects.âResilio is transformative for us. Once Resilio Platform was set up, everything just worked.â Guidolin appreciates the improved reliability, faster performance, and optimal bandwidth utilization: âIn one project we are constantly synchronizing 2TBs error-free across the WAN. Their bandwidth fluctuates for each office: some have very slow speeds and others, like Milan, have faster speeds. âWe use the bandwidth scheduler to allocate and manage bandwidth for all transfers across all of our offices.âResilio can use either TCP or UDP. For WAN transfers, Resilio overcomes latency and loss to provide Guidolin and his team predictability: We know how long transfers will take. Itâs also exponentially faster than our previous solutions.âOur criteria is speed based on projects and file types. Being able to have work on the same project file in different sites in a very fast way is a big win for us,â says Guidolin. âWe like the ease of management and automation.âEmanuele Guidolin, Maffeis Engineering IT ManagerâWe like the ease of management and automation.â By eliminating manual file sharing and sync processes, the Maffeis Engineering team can work from anywhere, trusting that the most current version of the project is always ready, on timeâall the time.Another area where Resilio excelled is global support. âWe get a quick response and resolve problems fast if they arise. We usually get responses within an hour or two. We have all the support we needâand in a fast way,â adds Guidolin.SummaryMaffeis Engineering's adoption of Resilio Platform has transformed their ability to share and collaborate across sites in real-timeâon mission-critical projects. By replacing inefficient manual processes with Resilio Platform, the company experiences significant improvements in workflow efficiency, project sharing, and real-time collaboration across sites.In summary, Maffeis Engineering appreciates benefits such as:Predictability: Feeling confident knowing that updates will be received by all team members in a timely manner, irrespective of their location.Faster delivery times: The company overcomes latency across sites to synchronize assets of any size and type 5-10x faster than previous solutions.Precision updates in real-time: Multiple team members instantly see changes to architectural project files in seconds across all locations.Data integrity preservation: Resilio Platform protects and preserves data integrity for all files, across all locations.Reduced TCO: Maffeis Engineering leverages existing NAS, eliminates unnecessary storage and minimizes data transfer across the WAN.Improved productivity: The time saved by team members through streamlined collaboration and file sharing translated into increased productivity and flexibilityâand the ability to produce more within fixed time frames under deadline pressure.âUsing Resilio Platform weâve taken multi-site collaboration to the next level,â adds Guidolin. âWeâve seen another world of improvement. Resilio has made a very big difference for us.âEmanuele Guidolin, Maffeis Engineering IT ManagerCustomerIndustryArchitecture, Engineering, and ConstructionProductResilio Active Everywhere PlatformSolutionRemote & Hybrid WorkOverviewMaffeis Engineering's adoption of Resilio Platform has transformed their ability to share and collaborate across sites in real-timeâon mission-critical projects.By replacing inefficient manual processes with Resilio Platform, the company experiences significant improvements in workflow efficiency, project sharing, and real-time collaboration across sites.Schedule a Demo First Name*Last Name*Business Email*Phone*Company Name*Job Title*What problem are you trying to solve?*error Featured ResourcesCase studyWest Valley ConstructionThe ability to upload and access data reliably from any location has enhanced productivity and ensured compliance with safety regulations.Learn MoreCase studyMercedes-Benz AGMercedes-Benz reduced their OS deployment time by 95%Learn Moreon-demand webinarSolving File Collaboration for Remote or Hybrid WorkIn this new webinar, weâll discuss remote work IT challenges and highlight popular use cases for Resilio in remote team environments.Weâll also show a live demo of Resilio Platform for remote work in action.Learn MoreArticlePeer-to-Peer vs Client Server: Whatâs the Difference?The client-server model is still common in IT systems but will always be slow for large file transfers.

Before adopting Resilio, the company faced significant challenges in data management and replication across these geographically dispersed office locations.Â Data replication proved especially difficult due to many factors, including slow internet bandwidth and high network latency averaging 100ms (a.k.a. long fat pipe network). Their previous data replication methods relied on Robocopy scheduled scripts and utilizing Microsoft DFS-Replication servers, making them highly inefficient and slow, especially when data files got bigger and bigger (more than 1GB file sizes).Â Typically about tens of gigabytes of data need to be sent to another design office in minutes over a fat-long Internet VPN pipe. This, coupled with the limitations of SMB, the chatty TCP protocol, and the high network latency cross-site VPN, severely impacted the speed, delivery, and reliability of file transfers across offices.âSending and receiving data files to our remote offices was too slow,â said infrastructure and cloud systems manager, Mohammad Badran. âThe very slow data transfer rates of our previous replication mechanisms meant our engineers were struggling with long delays that could potentially impact projects from being delivered on time.âIf Dar was going to take on the worldâs most exciting and ambitious architecture and development projects, the team needed a solution that could meet its needs and quickly provide two-way data replication across its internet VPN-connected offices.After an eight-month search of trying many modern file systems and collaboration technologies that failed to deliver, Dar finally found Resilio Active Everywhere.âWe tried many software solutions, but none of them could fulfill our technological requirements.

      "title": "NetApp EOSL Guide: Global File Cache Alternatives",
      "content": "BreadcrumbNetApp EOSL Guide: Global File Cache AlternativesNetApp's Global File Cache reaching end-of-service life makes finding an alternative a priority. Resilio offers superior performance, scalability, and compatibility without infrastructure changes, making it an ideal replacement.Konstantin Lissounov Â /Â September 18, 2024 IntroductionWith the recent announcement of NetApp's Global File Cache (GFC) reaching its end of service life (EOSL) on May 31, 2024, organizations relying on this service actively seek viable alternatives.Having a plan for an alternative is crucial, because without GFC, businesses may face disruptions in accessing and managing their distributed file systems efficiently. An alternative solution is necessary to ensure continuity in file access and performance, safeguard data integrity, and maintain productivity across global teams. Additionally, transitioning to a new service requires time for testing and implementation, making early planning essential to avoid potential downtime and operational challenges.NetApp GFCâformerly Talon Fastâhas come under scrutiny due to its limitations, such as inability to handle millions of files or large files efficiently, slow performance, and lack of endpoint caching capabilities.In this article, we will examine why Resilio Active Everywhere is a superior alternative to NetApp GFC, delivering faster performance, greater scalability, and enhanced functionalities without requiring any infrastructural changes.What is NetApp EOSL?NetApp EOSL (End of Service Life) refers to the point in time when NetApp, a prominent provider of data management solutions, will no longer offer support services for a particular hardware or software product. This includes technical support and maintenance updates. Once a product reaches its EOSL, organizations using it must either upgrade to a newer version or continue operation without official support, which could pose risks in terms of security and performance.The difference between EOSL and EOL (End of Life) is subtle, but significant. EOL indicates a product has reached the end of its sales life cycle, meaning it's no longer being sold or manufactured by the company. However, the product may still receive support and maintenance from the provider until it reaches its EOSL. Essentially, EOL marks the cessation of sales, while EOSL marks the end of support and service. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for businesses in planning hardware or software upgrades and ensuring continuous, supported operations.How to plan for the NetApp EOSLTo effectively plan for NetApp EOSL (End of Service Life) and mitigate risks, a company using NetApp GFC should:Conduct an Inventory Assessment: Identify all NetApp GFC systems approaching EOSL. This will help prioritize which systems need immediate attention.Evaluate Current Usage: Understand how each system is used and its criticality to business operations. This will help plan whether to replace, upgrade, or maintain the systems.Budget for Replacement or Upgrades: Allocate budget for replacing or upgrading systems to newer models. Consider cloud solutions for scalability and flexibility.Explore Third-Party Support Options: Look for reputable third-party maintenance providers who can offer support for systems beyond the EOSL date.Develop a Data Migration Plan: If transitioning to new systems, create a detailed plan for data migration, ensuring data integrity and minimal downtime.Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with NetApp announcements and EOSL schedules to anticipate future needs and avoid last-minute rushes.Risk Management: Develop a risk management strategy to address potential downtime or failures, including backup solutions and disaster recovery plans.User Training: Ensure IT staff are trained on new systems or solutions to maintain business continuity and efficient operations.Try a GFS Solution Built for ScaleSee the difference a distributed global file system approach makes for reliability, speed, and reducing egress costs with massive data movement.LEARN MOREResilio Active Everywhere is 100% Compatible with NetApp Global File CacheResilio Active Everywhere provides a lightweight, software-only solution that eliminates the need for additional hardware, reducing costs and simplifying deployment compared to NetApp GFC.With full support for SMB protocols, Resilio Active Everywhere ensures seamless integration into existing environments.
