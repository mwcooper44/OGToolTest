These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.

If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. We may disclose or transfer your PII in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company.

      "content": "What Lioness Means to Me - A Series by Lioness Team Collaborator June 21, 2020 6 min read lioness review vibrator By Stephanie Delgado, featuring Rachael WebsterWant to share a story? Check outthis page for more details! When the Lioness Vibrator was designed, sexual pleasure was not the only thing in mind; sexual exploration and understanding were also at the forefront. As Liz has mentioned in numerous interviews (likethis one with Nicole Dahlstrom from Women of Wearables) theLioness Vibrator came from the idea that we should be able to \"learn, explore, and have fun with our sexuality that [is] as diverse as our bodies and our experiences.‚Äù If you‚Äôve taken a look at Lioness Vibrator reviews, you know it‚Äôs no secret that it‚Äôs a great sex toy and rabbit vibrator. Still, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge just how great it is as a biofeedback device. This idea that you can visualize, understand, and improve your own sexual relationship with yourself is revolutionary. In a world where masturbation for people with vaginas is still taboo, it‚Äôs so important to be able to make space for the learning, exploration, and fun Liz and Anna had in mind when they developed the Lioness Smart Vibrator. This is why we came up with the ‚ÄúWhat Lioness Means to Me‚Äù series. We want to be able to go a step beyondLioness Vibrator reviews. We want to highlight the Lioness‚Äôs capabilities while giving all of those in our Pride the chance to speak for themselves. Below is the first in our series, a submission from Rachael. Rachael is a mom, a woman with a Ph.D., a college professor, and a self-proclaimed Lioness enthusiast. Check out her story below: Masturbating in the Name of Science and Motherhood It might sound like an exaggeration, but the Lioness Vibrator honestly changed my life. It changed how I view myself as a woman and how I communicate with others about my sexual well-being. As a Ph.D. scientist, college professor, general aviation pilot, PTA president, and mom, I have never put limits on what I can accomplish. I feel like I have the confidence and courage in so many parts of my life, but my sexual well-being has never been something I felt comfortable talking about. It wasn't that I was ashamed of anything specific, but I was never taught how to talk about it openly. Upon entering mid-life, I was grappling with the cliched question of ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù I felt like I lost my identity as I transitioned from being a daughter to a friend to a student to wife to professor to mother and I didn‚Äôt know where to go next. As I was struggling to find myself, my husband also was wrestling with his own mid-life crisis, which unfortunately ended up in us separating after being together for 20 years. As I was surveying the pile of rubble that was left of my life, I found the answer to my question of who I am: re-invention. I have continuously reinvented myself over the years to become who I needed to be to face life‚Äôs challenges, but I always crafted myself in relation to my immediate situation or someone else‚Äôs needs. This time, however, I chose to reinvent myself by uncovering the truths about who I really am. Little did I know, some of those truths would be discovered when I found a box collecting dust... Truth #1: I bought my Lioness to support their vision. My Lioness sat in its box for years. I actually asked my then-husband to purchase the Lioness Vibrator for me as a gift, but I had no intention of using it. This was when the Lioness first started advertising its product and I bought it for one reason only; I heard about this passionate women-led company that had an amazing product that was facing backlash from a culture with a double standard. Erectile dysfunction medication can be promoted everywhere, but how dare a \"wearable device\" company that visualizes data about a very common and physiologically-relevant biological process in over half of our population even think about advertising? The stigma and implied shame really spoke to me and I wanted to do what I could to show my support for this group of people who believe in something that is so fundamental. Truth #2: I was a stranger to my own orgasm magic. Besides a few romantic encounters with a showerhead and enjoying climbing the rope in gym class when I was a teenager, I had never experienced an orgasm outside of sex with a partner. I never gave it much thought and didn't feel like it was something I needed in my life. Given that, the Lioness was the first vibrator I ever purchased and used for my own personal pleasure. Truth #3: The Lioness vibrator normalized masturbation for me. Before I had graphs to visualize my masturbation, I didn't understand how to incorporate masturbation into my life in a way that didn't make me feel awkward. However, because I'm a numbers dork, having a quantitative reason to try the Lioness made it feel just like a FitBit or any other wearable device. The Lioness collects data about a physiological body process just like heart rate, so what's the big deal? Truth #4: Lioness has become a way for my mother and me to discuss topics we couldn‚Äôt before. I bought another Lioness Smart Vibrator and gave it to my mother for Christmas. My mom is someone in my life who has inspired me to always be true to myself. She has been an incredible role model for so many things, but sexual well-being and female masturbation, like in many households, was an awkward topic that she just didn't know much about or know how to talk about. Given my newfound excitement about the Lioness, I was able to show her the app and explain one of my graphs. The Lioness has let me feel personal freedom that I didn't know was possible and I wanted to share that with her and start the conversation in a way that conveyed love, support, and promoted well-being. She has since reported back that it worked well. :) Truth #5: I‚Äôm no longer ashamed to talk about masturbation. Thanks to my Lioness Vibrator, I can talk to my kids and friends about masturbation without shame. My kids have seen my Lioness and I have explained to them what it is. My son will probably need nothing more than a sock and hand lotion when he is of that age, so I plan on buying my daughter a Lioness when she is a teenager. There is no reason why she should live in apprehension like I did for most of my life about a very natural process that can give her so much freedom and pleasure. In addition, many of my mom friends are scientists and engineers who also feel awkward about talking about female masturbation (not something that rolls off the tongue at the playground), but with the graphical representation of my orgasm data, I am able to whip out my phone and have serious discussions about this previously taboo subject! Truth #6: I am an avalanche. The Lioness is an amazing vibrator, but what sets it apart is its ability to quantify the orgasm process by measuring pelvic floor contractions. Not only do I feel intense physical pleasure, but I also experience awesome mental pleasure by pouring over my own data after each session. There is very little research done on female orgasms (which baffles me), but with the Lioness, I was able to see which type of orgasm pattern I experience and that it is totally repeatable. How cool is that?! The Lioness has honestly changed my life. It has brought me closer with my mother, has opened up a dialogue with my kids that I hope to keep alive as they enter the awkward teenage years, and helped me experience a sense of personal freedom and pleasure that I never knew I could experience. Thank you Lioness for bringing all of these truths into my life and helping me discover who I really am.

      "content": "How to use the Lioness Vibrator as a couples sex toy by Liz Klinger December 12, 2018 8 min read app communication couples dating general guide high tech high tech sex toy orgasm relationship sex toy techniques vibrator Although the Lioness Vibrator is primarily thought of as a product forself-discovery, it‚Äôs also a great tool forour-discovery. Basically, what I‚Äôm saying is that it can also be one of the best sex toys out there for couples. Will I or my partner become overly reliant or desensitized by it? Nope. We did another story that goes into greater detail about the topic (you can read it here), but basically, you or your partner would not become overly reliant or desensitized by a sex toy. Desensitization from vibration can happen in cases such as if you‚Äôre in the construction industry working with large, industrial equipment every day, not using a comparatively small vibrator now and then (or even every day). You should be good in that department. üëç For those of you unfamiliar with this reference, he's saying \"They took our jobs!\" ... thank you South Park, lol Will this vibrator (or any toy) replace me or my partner? No‚ÄîI‚Äôd hope you wouldn‚Äôt compare your awesome self to an inanimate object! Introducing a variety of different sex toys can add some much-needed spice to your sex life (though we first recommend having a conversation about it with your partner before starting out). It‚Äôs also a great way to start more conversations about pleasure, learn about what you both like, and explore new heights of pleasure you never knew existed before. Think of it like going on a date to an exotic location, going to a hip new restaurant, or gifting some fine jewelry... Only better, because unlike a trip or a meal, a great sex toy is the gift that keeps on giving for years to come... and how often will they wear that expensive jewelry, anyway? In the case of our product the Lioness, we‚Äôve heard back from a number of couples who use the Lioness together in different ways and tell us how it has benefitted their relationship and made things more...interesting (in a good way). Back up, what is the Lioness Vibrator? Lioness is a smart vibrator made by a team of badass women engineers and designers that is able to capture then visualize arousal and orgasm from pelvic floor movements (vaginal contractions or anal contractions for anybody). If you‚Äôre looking for a sex toy that does something different than anything else, this definitely checks that box. You can also use Lioness as a remote control vibrator (local remote control now, online control available later this year as an app update). Unlike other remote control vibrators, you can see arousal and orgasmic response in real time from the app. That way, you know what movements and sensations work so you can be intimate and learn about each other's preferences at the same time. Example of pelvic floor contraction patterns that characterize an orgasm How have couples used the Lioness together? Couples have gotten very creative with how they‚Äôve used the Lioness Vibrator in obvious and not-so-obvious ways. Ultimately, they‚Äôve used the information and features to have better sex (with and without the vibrator). Pleasure can change a lot over time and differs from person to person 1. Learn what your partner likes (and doesn't like) Everyone is different. Your previous partner might like one thing, but your current partner may like something completely different. In comparison to other products out there, Lioness gives you the low-down on what your partner likes so you can know how to better please them. Furthermore, the mere conversation about sex is a taboo topic that many of us feel ashamed to talk about and is actively censored by nearly all major social platforms. Consequently, most of us keep things to ourselves, and we don‚Äôt learn other perspectives or how to empathize with others who have experiences outside of what we‚Äôve personally encountered. Lioness can help you put aside your assumptions and learn what you (or your partner) likes and their body‚Äîas well as how preferences change over time. ‚ÄúIt's been fun looking at the data and comparing notes...I appreciate getting new things all the time.‚Äù ‚Äî Tom ‚ÄúI love how it tells me how my orgasims are while using it during sex with my boyfriend or by myself. I also love the settings that I can use to make it more intense or not so intense with the vibration settings. I would love to see it happen on the app as I'm actually orgasiming‚Äù ‚Äî Sherry (real time on the app is now available as a free update on the Lioness app ‚Äî check it out here!) 2. Open up the conversation about pleasure Sex can be difficult to talk about for all sorts of reasons. Just look at reddit's \"bad womens anatomy\" subreddit and you‚Äôll see what I mean. Although this subreddit showcases some of the more extreme misconceptions about women and sex, many of us have misconceptions on some level. It‚Äôs no surprise, either‚Ä¶ Many of us don‚Äôt get great sex education (orany in some cases ‚Äî and ongoing education after grade school is nearly non-existent). Because of that, we often don‚Äôt have the language or framework to convey our experiences very well. Most importantly, our sexual preferences are shaped by our previous experiences (take this person whose orgasms became \"shitty\" overnight after a concussion), other things going on in our lives, anatomy, things like alcohol or cannabis, and even down to how we‚Äôre feeling that day. It‚Äôs not just simply being aroused, turned on, or having an orgasm means that you‚Äôre attracted/in love/etc. with another person. If only sex were that simple... right? Unfortunately, the reality is that it‚Äôs not, but it‚Äôs not a mystery, either. We‚Äôve found that Lioness has been a great way to present information about personal pleasure in a way that‚Äôs tangible and helps couples learn how to have better sex. Consider this review of Lioness from a journalist at Glamour: ‚Äú[Lioness] also helped me discuss my sexuality with my partner...Hearing my partner point to a chart and say, \"Is that your orgasm?\" broke down a barrier for us; we hadn't talked about my satisfaction that openly and frankly before. The fact that it was charted out made it more accessible and allowed for a clinical distance, like looking at a math problem rather than analyzing something so deeply personal.‚Äù Using Lioness has also helped to figure out what works and doesn‚Äôt work, especially in cases where you have questions about why things feel uncomfortable. ‚ÄúI had been dealing with pain during intercourse for the last five years. My boyfriend always worked with it and was understanding, but I was frustrated and ashamed that this issue seemingly came out of nowhere where...Using the Lioness a few times solo first helped me feel at ease and empowered to ask - I‚Äôm happy to report that I‚Äôve been able to consistently have painless sex since getting the Lioness! It also felt like opening the floodgates of communication - our relationship has benefitted from it both in intimacy and emotion, and it encouraged my boyfriend to be more open with me as well.‚Äù ‚Äî AM 3. Have fun! Be a little naughty ;) We‚Äôve heard of couples enjoying sharing their ‚Äúsessions‚Äù. With a screenshot, you can share an interesting insight from a recent session with your partner just like you‚Äôd share any other picture over your messaging app of choice. It strikes up a conversation, lets them know you‚Äôre being a little randy, and also lets them know you‚Äôre thinking of them. If you want to jazz up your orgasm a bit, you can also turn your orgasm into art and share it with your partner, too‚Äîone of our newest features enables just that (you can learn more about that here). It‚Äôs also a hint of some of the new experiences to come... Newest features Available as free app updates on iOS and Android One of the coolest things about Lioness is, even after you buy it, you continuously get new features and functionality from it over time, opening up the variety of experiences you can share together with your partner. It‚Äôs the only vibrator out there that can do that, and we‚Äôve been adding a variety of new functionality to it since it first launched over a year ago. So without further ado, these are some of the newest features you can explore with the Lioness Vibrator! (Last updated 3/11/2019) 1. Remote control vibrator One of the more common features out there, but for some couples, it‚Äôs essential to their sexual exploration together. It‚Äôs something we've working on introducing for a while, especially because many remote control sex toys in the past have had issues maintaining a connection, and we have high standards for anything we roll out, we‚Äôre designing our remote control feature so it can maintain a smoother connection... 2. ‚ÄúLive View‚Äù ‚Äî see your orgasms in real-time from the app See orgasms in real-time while using the Lioness Vibrator. This is something that is unique to the Lioness Vibrator because of its specific suite of sensors, Artgasm, and the AI/ML that powers things. People have already found ways to can tinker with this from what‚Äôs already on the Lioness app. We‚Äôve had a few creative people do this at play parties already, so we worked on something that is easier and smoother for anyone with a Lioness to use. ‚ÄúAnother creative use of the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù functionality that we‚Äôve heard is creating live shows where an individual masturbates with the Lioness with the display projected on-screen from their mobile device. This is able to create an interesting and unique backdrop for larger parties. We‚Äôll actually be rolling out (very soon) the ability to apply the real-time data to our Artgasm visualization (as shown below), which also captures motion and motor settings in addition to vaginal contractions.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it was a bigger event and we had a bunch of couples here. We were still getting to all know each other, but it was really hot to see one woman pleasing herself and us being able to actually see her vag‚Äôs response. We didn‚Äôt have the best setup, since it was just on the phone, but it was still pretty hot. I‚Äôm looking to have a projector next time.‚Äù ‚Äî Liza (And, of course, if swinger or play parties aren‚Äôt your thing, you can also do something similar privately with just you and your S.O.) 3. Remote ‚ÄúLive Sex‚Äù If you can do remote control and remote imagery‚Ä¶ you can do remote ‚Äúlive sex‚Äù. As another dimension for adding connection and intimacy with your partner, you can control the vibrator, see your partner (via your messaging app of choice),andeven see them become more aroused and orgasmic in their own, unique way. You could also play around with techniques like orgasm control and explore all sorts of ways to make them (or you) orgasm in a variety of ways. ‚ÄúI've found it especially useful for doing edging or orgasm control with someone new. It's not something you don't learn over time, but it both speeds up the process and makes it a lot easier to do new stuff and see how it affects things.‚Äù ‚Äî Alex What are you waiting for?

Everything is encrypted and we fully anonymize the data‚Äîeven we do not know who is who. Our guiding principle is that we treat your data the same way we would want our own to be treated. We follow security best practices and consistently keep our systems up-to-date to deal with the latest threats. But all of that just does what we consider the bare minimum and doesn't prevent abuse or misuse of data. Because of our focus on this topic, we have a few core philosophies that we hold regarding data:Always anonymous. We're a data-based product and company, and the value we provide to users is from that. But not everything provides you value‚Äînamely, personally-identifying information (PII). We always fully encrypt our databases, and go above and beyond in fully anonymizing our users, and studiously avoiding collecting PII unless necessary. This is because we realize something a lot of other companies don't. Collecting everything \"just in case\" rarely ever pays off... but always has a big cost in risk to your privacy. We don't play those games with your data.Explicit, enthusiastic, informed consent. Related to understanding data is both value but also liability, we don't secretly trawl your entire life in the background. We strive in our design to always be clear what is being collected and, if not obvious, why. Our mindset is if we went through each piece of data we collect, the answer should be an enthusiastic answer yes to what is provided. In fact, we go so far as to build in explicitness even in our UI‚Äîyour vibrator never sync or secretly sends anything. You MUST explicitly hit the sync button on the app for it to ever communicate. We're not fans of cloak and dagger, not with our intimate products.Defense-in-depth, minimize attack surface. We're not an old traditional company trying to adapt to the new digital world. Our team are from some of the top technology companies in the world, and we understand the realities of security in this age of cyber threats. We build our systems like a medieval castle‚Äîlayers upon layers. Although we don't expect it to happen, if our public endpoints are breached, they don't actually hold data. Even if our private networks are breached, our databases are encrypted, and hence gibberish without our private keys. Even if our databases are decrypted, all user data is one-way hashed, so it can't be backed out without a complete user list. But even if OUR servers are hacked, our authentication servers with user lists are NOT kept with us‚Äîthey at one of the top authentication and security providers in the world. So the hackers now need to go breach them. And so on and so forth. We know being tested in security isn't matter of if, but when, and treat your data as we do our own.So, what DO we do with the data? Well, with the anonymized data, we use it internally to learn new things, improve our app, and most importantly, further our knowledge of female sexuality. A lot of this requires volunteers where we can have known data points, and then extrapolate the benefits of that knowledge to the fully anonymized pool (and also be able to then do validation that what we're seeing is actually more broadly reflected in the female population). Our access to this kind of information is unprecedented, and we‚Äôre dedicated to using this for good.For example, in our exploration of orgasm patterns, we were able to replicate some of the physiological studies last done in the 1980s (... with a sample size of 11), and find things that are suggestive that there's even more to uncover). As a part of our mission, we are eager to continue these kinds of advancements. In fact, we're working on partnerships with outside academic and medical researchers right now. However, in all of those cases, we will only share data if the user has specifically opted in‚Äîespecially since academic research by its very nature requires FAR more identifying data than we've been comfortable collecting. (Our CTO lays out some of the differences between what we do and academic research here) As part of that, we're still figuring out the right balance. No matter what, though, we promise that it won't just \"magically\" happen in the background. Everything MUST be explicit and clear.The way we see it, for some folks, privacy is freedom. For others, contributing and participating in science and research can be exciting and fulfilling. But whatever decision it is must be informed by direct, clear consent. We're not fans of the 10,000 word terms of services that bury this stuff and suddenly change where you stand without you knowing. If we're using the data for something that might risk unveiling you, we'll let you know and only do it if you consent.See Other Frequently Asked Questions Search our shop What are you looking for?

I lasted a whopping 2 mins and 49 seconds with the actual sex toy and found my original questions answered completely. But masturbating with the Lioness goes beyond each session. Once I opened the app and synced my session, I found I had a few more questions! So, like any good amateur Sexual Scientist would do, I took my questions straight to the source: Liz Klinger, CEO & Co-founder of Lioness. Whether you‚Äôre interested in purchasing a Lioness, or have one in the mail on its way to you, I highly encourage reading through my questions before giving your own smart vibrator a whirl. by Kate Delgado 6 min read Read more Crave Vesper Makes Me Feel Fancy While Having Orgasms When experimenting with Lioness, I‚Äôve sometimes given the suggestion of trying different sensations with different external stimulators, using the Lioness more a measurement tool by keeping the vibration off using the customizable vibration settings.

We talk freely about the role that masturbation plays in our everyday lives, but it hasn‚Äôt always been that way. From the Victorian era (1800s) until the 1970‚Äôs, it was fairly taboo to talk about masturbation. From the 1920‚Äôs to the 1950‚Äôs, sex toys were marketed as household appliances or self-massagers, even though it was common knowledge that these products were used for sexual pleasure. As a tribute to the sex toy legends that paved the way for our Lioness Vibrators, we‚Äôve put together a list of noteworthy sex toys throughout history. by Lioness Team 8 min read Read more Crave Vesper Makes Me Feel Fancy While Having Orgasms When experimenting with Lioness, I‚Äôve sometimes given the suggestion of trying different sensations with different external stimulators, using the Lioness more a measurement tool by keeping the vibration off using the customizable vibration settings.

      "title": "Data Shows Male & Female Orgasms Aren't That Different - Lioness",
      "content": "The Battle of Male Orgasms vs Female Orgasms: Is There a Difference? by Anna Lee April 23, 2019 3 min read anal play data lioness vibrator orgasm Ah, the great, long orgasm battle between man vs woman. One of life‚Äôs greatest mysteries of understanding what the opposite sex experiences during an orgasm. In the past 3 years working on Lioness and talking about the data of orgasms, we get a lot of questions about male vs female orgasms: ‚ÄúHow do women orgasm?‚Äù \"What does an orgasm feel like for women?\" ‚ÄúAre orgasms better for men or women?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are women‚Äôs orgasms more complicated than men‚Äôs?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan men use the Lioness?‚Äù For a while, I could only refer to different scientific papers and models which gets overwhelming even for me to fully understand all the schools of thought. For years, scholars and researchers have been trying to define the differences between male and female sexual responses and orgasms. Some disagree with the models that are published while others build on it, which can make this a tricky and complicated subject. For example, one of the more popular models were introduced by William H. Masters and Virginia Johnson in 1966. It's a four-stage model called the human sexual response cycle: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Source: Wikipedia There are many more published models since, like Dr. Helen Kaplan's three-stage model, Barry Singer‚Äôs model of sexual arousal and Rosemary Basson‚Äôs sexual response cycle that focuses on specifically women‚Äôs sexual responses cycles. But what does this all mean? Are we different or not?! Luckily, because of my desire to share my orgasms with the world (double penetration, weed lube, CBD) to help ignite curiosity in others and probably THRILL my mom, I‚Äôm back to share more of my data. I found a rockstar, male Lioness customer who wanted to share his anal masturbation orgasm data with the world along with my vaginal masturbation data, so we can compare and contrast. Before I get into it, there are a few things I‚Äôd like to note: This article uses the term female and male for cisgendered sexual anatomy and to describe sexual organs. Both data sets are from self-identifying cisgender people. This is as ‚Äúscientific‚Äù and a controlled ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù as two people masturbating in their respective rooms with their Lionesses get. An ‚Äúorgasm‚Äù can be a difficult thing to define because many medical professionals and researchers define orgasms differently. The Male vs Female Orgasm Results I‚Äôve been so giddy with excitement waiting for my male participant to send me over his data. As soon as I saw his session‚Äôs graph, it put a huge grin on my face. It absolutely didn‚Äôt disappoint. Maybe you can see why. Here‚Äôs mine: ‚ÄúAn orgasm for me feels like huge breath after holding your breath for a long time. It‚Äôs this feeling of total relaxation and warmness through my body‚Äù And here‚Äôs his: ‚ÄúAn orgasm for me feels like electricity is going through your body. It intensifies more the moment you let go.‚Äù Are you seeing it?! Don‚Äôt they look kind of similar? Of course, the Y-axis representing force is much higher and contracting/releasing at a much larger differences for the male data since anal muscles are much stronger than vaginal muscles, but it‚Äôs pretty neat to see the entire session‚Äôs pattern be similar to each other. When you look just at the orgasm portion of each session, you can see there is a rhythmic pelvic floor movement of consistent contraction and relaxation for both the male anal and female vaginal data. The Lesson Although this was more of a fun, observational experiment between the two of us, it honestly helped relax my mind a little bit to realize that maybe the opposite sex‚Äôs orgasms aren‚Äôt as much of a black box mystery as I always concluded it to be. Especially after digging through scientific papers and articles, it only made me more overwhelmed thinking that I‚Äôll never fully understand. Of course, there are so many aspects beyond physiological data that wasn‚Äôt captured by this little experiment like emotional, age, disorders, arousal, etc, but it at least made me take a breath and realize it doesn‚Äôt have to be a mysterious battle of male versus female. It‚Äôs all just human responses! Intrigued? Self-Experiment with the Lioness... I‚Äôd love to keep discovering and sharing more data with the world.

      "content": "Lioness versus Researcher by Liz Klinger May 19, 2019 3 min read data lioness vibrator orgasm review vibrator (hint: Lioness wins) By Dr. Natasha Aduloju-Ajijola PhD, MPH [[ Lioness Editor Note: We're introducing stories shared by members of the Lioness Pride ‚Äî people who own the Lioness Vibrator ‚Äî as a space for people to share their experiences, get a broader perspective of pleasure, and learn how people use Lioness in their everyday lives. ]] So, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done any type of blogging so I forget how to really begin. So I guess I‚Äôll begin with who am I. I am a sexual health researcher, so basically I get to talk about sex all day without people thinking I‚Äôm a (complete) weirdo. I‚Äôm also a woman who has stresses, frustrations, good days, bad days, and a sex drive. I use the Lioness in many different aspects of my life and I‚Äôm so excited to share my experiences. My process The first time I used the Lioness, I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but my experience was so much more than what I thought it would be. I have workaholic tenancies, so I get tired and do not always feel like putting energy into masturbating. I‚Äôll do a mini cost benefit analysis of the energy it will take to get out of bed and the amount of pleasure I expect to get. Before, I would just roll onto a bullet, with underwear and everything still on, have a quick orgasm, and go to sleep. Basically, I was using masturbating as a way to fall asleep quicker rather than a way to actually have any type of pleasure in my life. Above: Example of orgasm data ‚Äî the circle and chart represent the pelvic floor movements involved in arousal and orgasm Since I‚Äôm a researcher, I‚Äôm ALL about the data. It‚Äôs actually one of the things that attracted me to Lioness, I love that I have the ability to better understand my sexuality in the same ways I use my fitbit to track my sleep, exercise, and resting heart rate. So the first day I got my Lioness in the mail, I decided that I needed to collect some amazing data. \"I thought I was having a seizure because my orgasms were so intense.\" For the first time in a while, I decided to put energy into seducing myself. I took a hot shower, used the satin bed sheets, tried to find a non-irritating porn, and really worked on setting the mood. Well... the mood setting worked. I was super excited and ready when I began to actually use the Lioness, my first orgasm took me completely off guard. Because I knew I was collecting data, I really pushed myself to collect someamazing data. Apparently, I have voyeuristic tenancies. But let me tell you, at one point I thought I was having a seizure because my orgasms were so intense. I have never had orgasms that intense in my life ‚Äî and I have a lot of experience with orgasms. Orgasmic fireworks Since that first time using the Lioness, I have spent a lot of time looking at my data and trying to make sense of it. My pattern did not really match the other patterns that we have seen with the Lioness- my orgasm pattern oscillates between high pressure and low pressure very rapidly. It made me remember when I took a class in human sexuality back in undergrad and we had to draw our orgasm- I drew a lot of fireworks. Above: Two examples of my own sessions ‚Äî see the rapid oscillation throughout? The fireworks were different colors, sizes, and scents (I used scents and regular markers). My pattern of fireworks, matched well with how I drew my orgasm all those years ago. Now using the data, I am able to understand what is happening when it feels like my orgasm ‚Äúslips away‚Äù, or how my stress affects both my pattern and orgasm awareness‚Ä¶ but those are blog posts for another day. :) === Ready to explore yourself?

      "title": "How To Navigate Painful Sex With Lioness",
      "content": "An artist navigates painful sex with the Lioness Vibrator by Liz Klinger June 06, 2019 5 min read data lioness lioness vibrator review Understanding pleasure through data By AM, 31, artist [[ Lioness Editor Note: We're introducing stories shared by members of the Lioness Pride ‚Äî people who own the Lioness Vibrator ‚Äî as a space for people to share their experiences, get a broader perspective of pleasure, and learn how people use Lioness in their everyday lives. ]] How long have you had Lioness? I've had Lioness since summer 2017 (I was one of the early Indiegogo backers!) What initially piqued your interest about Lioness? I was really attracted to the data-tracking, particularly with regards to muscle contraction. At the time, I was struggling with pain during intercourse and was diagnosed with vaginismus, so I wanted to see for myself what that looked like. What has been the most surprising thing you‚Äôve learned since getting the Lioness? I thought I was fairly open-minded around the topic of sex, coming from a progressive family and having access to fairly robust sex education, so I was surprised how little I actually knew about myself and how I experience pleasure. Through using Lioness, I learned what my orgasm pattern was (Wave buddies, where you at?), that quick orgasms and multiple orgasms are quite easy for me to achieve, but they will never be the exploding-fireworks-then-body-goes-limp orgasms I had read about or seen in novels, fanfics, tv and movies (not that I'm complaining!). You mentioned that you‚Äôve been able to use Lioness to help address painful sex. Could you talk a little more about that? About two years into my relationship with my boyfriend, sex suddenly became painful. It was like my body would not let him in, and I couldn't understand it: I want to have sex with my boyfriend! Why is my body betraying me this way? No matter how much I wanted it or how much lube we tried, I couldn't get through sex without crying or gritting my teeth. My boyfriend was so patient, but just as confused as I was, and at some point we barely had sex anymore. After a few years, I went to my doctor and she diagnosed me with vaginismus. Candidly speaking, her first question was whether I was being abused, explaining that patients with vaginismus are often victims of trauma or abuse. This was not the case with me, but it did shed a light on how mental sex can be. We likely had one example of not-so-great sex at some point, but it was enough to send my brain into an ever-escalating cycle of \"It's gonna hurt\", \"No it's not, calm down\", \"It hurts!\", \"Because you're not calm!\". My doctor was empathetic, but ultimately the only thing she could suggest was to relax. In a way, it was reassuring to be told that there wasn't something \"wrong\" with me, that other women experience it, that it was all in my head...but also just as frustrating to be told it was all just in my head. Fast-forward to getting the Lioness. Using it on my own really helped me relax and familiarize myself with my body again, but it also empowered me to be open about my needs. I realized I was still keeping a lot to myself about what my body needed, that I was scared to come off as demanding or high-maintenance (despite being the biggest demand-your-pleasure advocate to my friends). Opening these conversations also revealed that my boyfriend was surprisingly shy and inexperienced talking about sex, as he did not have the same comprehensive education I had; he had been looking to me for initiation and guidance. I'm happy to report that after 5 years of painful sex, Lioness has helped me enjoy intimacy pain-free for the last 2 years! Not only has the data enabled an open dialogue for us that was instrumental to my healing, but the wealth of knowledge that Lioness shares on social media/blogs/newsletters has emboldened me to suggest new things to try with him, such as Foria Awaken and Ohnut. What about birth control and pleasure? I had been on NuvaRing for about 9 years, but switched to the Mirena IUD in 2017 for convenience and because I had a history of migraines. During my consultation, I mentioned that I felt my sex drive had dropped off considerably in the last few years - obviously, the pain was a big factor, but my doctor also suggested it was possible switching to Mirena would help, since it was a progestin hormone rather than the estrogen/progestin combination found in NuvaRing. Unfortunately, I don't have any pre-IUD data with Lioness, as I had it inserted a few months before my Lioness arrived, but I found these changes to be obvious enough: Before NuvaRing, I would always feel heightened arousal and sensitivity in the days just before my period. In general, it was pretty easy for me to get in the mood on any day. While on NuvaRing, I didn't feel this as much, and it disappeared in the last few years on the ring. It took longer for me to feel aroused and ready overall - the desire was there mentally, but I felt like what used to happen very naturally in my body suddenly needed to be supplemented with more and more lube. I also found it harder to achieve orgasm with a partner in the last few years on the ring, but that could largely be because of the pain. About two months after inserting Mirena, despite my period pretty much becoming non-existent, I began experiencing those pre-period \"thirsty days\" as I like to call them. üòè In general, it feels like my drive has returned since making the switch to Mirena. I don't know if my experience is common, but it was a pleasant surprise! Anything else you‚Äôd like to share? I'm really grateful for the how Lioness has changed my sex life for the better, and for this chance to share my experience in case others have felt the same thing. It's so common for stigma and shame to push us into silent suffering, but it does not have to be that way. The data Lioness provided helped me understand my pain, but the stories and knowledge shared within the Lioness Pride illustrated for me how to work around and beyond it, that I was not doomed to painful sex (or no sex) forever. I can't wait to learn more from the Pride, and I'm looking forward to exploring more with myself and with my boyfriend! === Ready to explore yourself?

      "title": "Interview With Von, Pioneer Of Sex Positive Synth Pop - Lioness",
      "content": "Interview with Von, Pioneer of Sex Positive Synth Pop by Liz Klinger December 20, 2018 5 min read art music Von is a New York City-based pop star/musician, student at the renown NYU Clive David Institute of Recorded Music, and one-woman writer, producer, performer, and sound engineer. Her hits include Action and Too Many, as well as her upcoming release Lollipop. Both of these songs used sound elements created from her orgasm, using the Lioness Vibrator! Naturally, we wanted to share more about her and her sex positive synth pop (literal genre name‚Äîit's great) with our readers. What‚Äôs your background? I‚Äôm from a pretty traditional suburb in Pennsylvania. My dad‚Äôs an accountant and the rest of my family works in social work, education, service management, marketing etc. In other words pretty normal jobs. Saying I wanted to be an artist for a living was especially out of the ordinary to the rest of my family members. How did you find out about us? How has the Lioness been different from other vibrators (in terms of functionality, experience, etc)? I found out about Lioness really by accident. I originally wanted to use just vibration patterns from vibrators, so I was reaching out to sex toy companies asking if I could have different types of data for various products. Through a lot of google searches, I kind of stumbled upon Lioness. Once I read more and realized what it could do I was like‚Ä¶ oh man, this could really be crazy. I think the reason this worked so seamlessly with Lioness is because what I was asking for was already apart of Lioness‚Äô mission to their consumers. Usually, such specific data is a backend operation, that customers don‚Äôt see/don‚Äôt care about. Lioness is essentially a health app, at least for me. The goal of the company is to provide me with as much of my data as possible in a fully transparent medium. This is super different from other vibrators - Lioness goes beyond the initial experience to give yourself a deeper understanding of your body. That, to me, is crazy cool. How has the Lioness Vibrator changed your music? It‚Äôs honestly become another essential instrument. Whereas before my most important instrument was my computer, now it‚Äôs also my Lioness. I really think of it now as a fully assimilated part of music making process. My actual sound hasn‚Äôt changed much, but my process and ability to customize my sound design have definitely changed how connected I feel to the music I‚Äôm making. Von's orgasm in editing software. Why is the topic of sexual pleasure so important to you? Sexuality is so inherently human and is yet something that so many people are still ashamed to talk about. For me, it isn‚Äôt sexual pleasure that‚Äôs so important but more so respect and validation. The same way you need communication to succeed in friendships/work/every other aspect of life, you need communication during any sexual experience. Sex has been made so taboo that non men specifically don‚Äôt have the necessary education/confidence/ability to talk about sexual pleasure openly. Giving those people voices to do so is what‚Äôs most important to me. What has the reception been for your music? What has been the most surprising thing you‚Äôve learned/discovered on your artistic journey? Overwhelming!! Haha for so long I‚Äôve been used to just making music completely alone in my basement apartment. Sharing it with people is so new, let alone sharing it with a bunch of strangers. I‚Äôm blown away by how positive the response has been. I‚Äôve been in such a bubble. There are so many people out there who are just as passionate about all the things I‚Äôm talking about as I am. I‚Äôve made so many internet friends and just found so many spaces that have really welcomed me with open arms. Whether it be other sex tech communities or just sex positive meme accounts on twitter, I‚Äôve really found my people from sharing my music. Photos by Farah Idrees What‚Äôs been the reception from your professors and other people you‚Äôve worked with? I love school, so I‚Äôm always excited to share whatever I‚Äôm working on with my professors. Some get it, some don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs life in general, especially when what you‚Äôre doing is somewhat niche. I‚Äôm actually really happy that most of my professors had no idea what sex tech was until I started talking about it. It makes me have to practice explaining what I‚Äôm doing to people that may not understand. I‚Äôm really blessed that even though all of my professors aren‚Äôt 100% well versed in what sex tech is/means, they‚Äôve given me nothing but support and super helpful critical feedback. Their goal at the end of the day is to help us find our thing and commit to it. Based on that they‚Äôve more than done their job. You‚Äôve mentioned you‚Äôve gotten different reactions from men and women. Could you tell me a bit more about that? There have been some people who just tell me I‚Äôm gross and crazy, both men and women. Which is fine, because again, what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt for everyone. But with those people aside, men usually sound more surprised about the stuff I‚Äôm writing about than women.

Most women are like, yeah thanks for saying something about this, it‚Äôs about time. There are other men who‚Äôve said super rude things to me about my music and it‚Äôs message.

      "content": "How to Orgasm During Sex: Science-Based Guide for Women by Anna Lee September 07, 2025 6 min read couples guide orgasm relationship Let me start with something that might surprise you: only 18.4% of women reported that intercourse alone was sufficient for orgasm. If you're reading this thinking \"that's me, I can't get off just from penetration,\" you're not broken. You're normal. You're part of the majority. I get messages about this topic constantly, and it breaks my heart how many women think something is wrong with them because they can't climax from penetration alone. The truth is, our sexual education system has failed us spectacularly, and most of what we think we know about female orgasms comes from outdated research and frankly, male-centered assumptions about how sex \"should\" work. The Real Problem: We've Been Thinking About Female Anatomy All Wrong Here's what most people don't understand about female sexual anatomy: the clitoris is massive. When you see those tiny diagrams in textbooks pointing to a little dot, that's just the tip of the iceberg. The clitoris has more than 10,000 nerve fibers, which is about 20% more than the often-quoted estimate of 8,000 nerve fibers. Inside your body, your clitoris is shaped like an upside-down wishbone, with a clitoral body branching out to form a V shape. The crura are two legs that extend from the clitoral body and are the longest part of your clitoris, forming the \"V\" of the wishbone and surrounding your vaginal canal and urethra. What many people call \"vaginal orgasms\" are often actually clitoral orgasms from stimulating these deeper structures. About 75 percent of all women never reach orgasm from intercourse alone -- that is without the extra help of sex toys, hands or tongue. This is why most women need some form of clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, whether that's direct external stimulation or indirect stimulation through the internal clitoral structures. What Actually Works: Practical Solutions for Better Sex Based on the research and countless conversations with women, here are the most effective approaches: 1. Simultaneous Stimulation During Penetration This is often the holy grail for many couples. Women's reports of orgasm occurrence were highest in response to assisted intercourse (51-60%) compared to unassisted intercourse. Ways to make this happen: Manual stimulation: Your partner can stimulate your clitoris with their fingers during penetration Vibrators designed for couples: These can be worn during sex to provide clitoral stimulation Positioning: Certain positions like woman-on-top allow for better clitoral contact or the ability to stimulate yourself Modern vibrators designed for couples can provide the additional stimulation many women need during penetration 2. Extended Foreplay and Afterplay The idea that sex ends when the man climaxes is outdated and frankly selfish. Good partners understand that: Foreplay should be extensive and focused on your arousal If you haven't climaxed yet, the session isn't over Oral sex, manual stimulation, or toy use after penetration should be standard, not special 3. Communication and Education This might be the most important point. Many men simply don't know about female anatomy and arousal patterns. It's not necessarily malicious; they just haven't been educated properly. The Science Behind Why This Matters Research shows that women who have regular orgasms experience numerous health benefits: Better sleep quality - orgasms achieved with a partner resulted in good sleep outcomes, while orgasms achieved through masturbation resulted in better sleep quality and reduced the time taken to fall asleep Reduced stress and anxiety - orgasms are a powerful stress reliever, with hormones and endorphins released during sex bringing on feelings of euphoria and relaxation, while also reducing cortisol levels Improved immune function - sexual activity boosts your body's natural infection-fighting skills with the release of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and sexually active women have greater changes in infection-fighting cells Better relationship satisfaction - studies have found that having sex regularly can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve overall mood Increased overall well-being - from pain relief and heart health to improved mood, better relationships, and less stress, the female orgasm can be a powerful tool in promoting overall wellness Yet studies consistently show that women fake orgasms at alarming rates, often to protect their partner's ego or to end unsatisfying encounters more quickly. Breaking Down the Myths Myth 1: \"Vaginal Orgasms Are Superior\" This goes back to Freud, who incorrectly claimed that clitoral orgasms were \"immature\" and women should graduate to vaginal orgasms. Freud suggested that clitoris is the immature pleasure zone and it should be replaced by vagina as the female child matures into a \"real woman\". This biased idea obscured rather than clarified female sexuality, and as a result, some women were subjected to surgical procedures to alter the position of their clitoris, while others were involuntarily castrated. This has been thoroughly debunked, but the stigma persists. Myth 2: \"Good Partners Should Just Know\" No one is born knowing how to please a partner. Every woman's body is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. Communication is essential. Myth 3: \"Using Toys Means Something Is Wrong\" Absolutely not. Toys are tools that can enhance pleasure for both partners. There's nothing wrong with using whatever works for your body. Understanding Your Own Body Here's something crucial: you need to understand your own body before you can guide a partner. In my work, I've asked thousands of women: \"What is your most reliable route to orgasm?\" Only 4% say penetration. The other 96% say clitoral stimulation, alone or paired with penetration. This means: Exploring what types of touch feel good Understanding your arousal patterns Learning what positions and angles work best for you Being comfortable with your own anatomy This is where technology can actually help. Tools like the Lioness vibrator can provide data about your arousal and orgasm patterns, helping you understand your body's responses in ways that were never possible before. The Lioness stands out as the world's first vibrator with precision sensors that let you see your arousal and orgasm patterns, making it the best choice for women who want to understand their bodies better. Modern technology like the Lioness vibrator provides detailed data about your arousal patterns, helping you understand your unique sexual response Practical Tips for Better Sexual Experiences Before Sex Have honest conversations about what you need Don't fake orgasms (this only perpetuates the problem) Set expectations that both partners' pleasure matters During Sex Guide your partner's hands to where you need stimulation Use positions that allow for clitoral contact Don't be afraid to pause and add more stimulation when needed After Penetration If you haven't climaxed, communicate that you'd like to continue Use whatever method works best for you: oral, manual, toys, or self-stimulation Remember that good partners want you to feel satisfied too The Bottom Line Sexual satisfaction shouldn't be a luxury or something you have to fight for. It should be a standard part of any sexual encounter. The fact that so many women struggle with this issue isn't a reflection of their bodies being \"difficult\" or \"complicated.\" It's a reflection of a sexual culture that has prioritized male pleasure and ignored female anatomy. Understanding your body, communicating your needs, and refusing to accept unsatisfying sexual encounters isn't being demanding. It's being smart about your own well-being. Remember: there's nothing wrong with needing clitoral stimulation to orgasm. There's nothing wrong with using toys. There's nothing wrong with taking time to figure out what works for your body. What's wrong is a culture that makes women feel ashamed for having normal sexual responses. FAQ Is it normal that I can't orgasm from penetration alone? Absolutely. 81.6% of women don't orgasm from intercourse alone (without additional clit stimulation). Only 18.4% of women report that intercourse alone is sufficient to orgasm. You're in the majority, not the minority. Will using a vibrator during sex make me dependent on it? No, this is a myth. Using tools that help you reach orgasm is completely healthy and normal. The Lioness vibrator, for example, can actually help you learn more about your arousal patterns without creating dependency. How do I talk to my partner about needing more stimulation? Be direct but positive. Focus on what feels good rather than what's not working. Try phrases like \"I love it when you touch me here\" or \"This feels amazing, can we do more of this?\" Is there something wrong with me if I need a lot of foreplay? Not at all. Women's arousal patterns are typically different from men's. Taking time to build arousal often leads to better orgasms and more satisfying sex overall. Can the Lioness vibrator really help me understand my body better? Yes! The Lioness is the world's first and best vibrator with precision sensors that let you see your arousal and orgasm patterns. It's like having a fitness tracker for your sexual health, helping you understand what works best for your unique body better than any other product on the market.

      "content": "Sexperiment Results: Does edging improve orgasms? by Kate Delgado August 29, 2025 2 min read data edging lioness vibrator In April 2024, we launched Sexperiments ‚Äî spicy science projects for adults you can access right in your Lioness mobile app. Lioness users around the world delayed their orgasms to answer the age-old question: does edging really make orgasms better? Let‚Äôs get into the Lioness data we collected. A Quick review of edging hypotheses We‚Äôre in the business of masturbating smarter, so each Sexplorer was prompted to formulate two hypotheses before beginning their Sexperiment. Hypothesis 1: How long do you think edging will increase your session length by? Edging requires someone to get close to orgasm, stop stimulation, and then resume over and over again. Naturally, this should increase how long someone spends masturbating, but there‚Äôs no golden standard for how many times someone can edge, so this first hypothesis required Lioness users to consider how long they might be able to edge for. Answers were mixed, but the majority of people reporting they thought edgingwould add 15 minutes or less to their typical session. Hypothesis 2: Do you think edging will improve your orgasms in a noticeable way? If you‚Äôre already familiar with edging, then you know that the claim is that delaying your orgasm should produce a more intense and pleasurable orgasm. When asked if they think edging will improve their orgasms, 86% of Lioness users hypothesized ‚Äúyes‚Äù and only 14% hypothesized ‚Äúno.‚Äù The Results: Did edging increase average session and orgasm length? Yes! For most users, edging increased both session and orgasm length. On an aggregate scale, session length increased by 5 mins and 24 seconds, while orgasm length increased by 9 seconds! The Results: Did edging increase average orgasm force? Surprisingly, no! Average peak force of reported ‚Äúnon-edging‚Äù orgasms was 64.9 gF with 26.5 gF being the average for relaxation between pelvic floor contractions. For reported ‚Äúedging‚Äù orgasms, however, force reached an average high of 61.6 gF and low of 29.6 gF. This suggests edging not only decreased the average peak force of orgasms, but also created less relaxation between pelvic floor contractions. Conclusion: So does edging improve orgasms? Overall, the data points to yes! For most people who did the Sexperiment, edging increased both time spent masturbating and orgasm length. Just remember, there is nuance, as with all things related to sex and some folks found edging ruined their O‚Äôs. The only way to definitely answer if edging will improve your orgasm is to start doing it for science. Ready to join Sexperiments? Get your Lioness Smart Vibrator today!
